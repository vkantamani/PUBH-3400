ASSESSMENT 5 â€“ CREATE AN EPI DATA BRIEF 
DUE December 8th   (25 points) 
General Instructions: Your group will create an Epi Data Brief to respond to a research question your group decides upon. The data brief can be no longer than 2 pages. You will submit a data brief that has the following sections:

    1. Title 
    2. Background 
    3. Definitions 
    4. Description of the population
    5. Results 
    6. Figures (2 of 3: graphs, tables, maps) 
    7. Implications 

You will be graded on both the content and design of the data brief. Please see the rubric on the next page. Use the rubric to ensure your group has included all components of the data brief. The audience of a data brief (DB) is policy makers, and the purpose of a DB is to share the importance of the outcome of interest.
